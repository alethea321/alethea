<p Style="color: black"> HISTORY OF THE COMPANY
<p Style="color: black">Korean baked goods (한국 생과자, "hanguk saenggwacha", lit. "Korean style snacks" 한국 빵, “hanguk ppang” lit. Korean bread") consist of Korean-style bread, buns, pastries, cakes, and snacks. Korean bread did not enter Korean diets or become a mainstream staple until the late 1980s. To a large extent, bread was not part of Korean cuisine, other than some types of traditional steamed bread that were made of mixed rice flour and wheat. Korean breads were first introduced to the mainstream market in the 1980s with the establishment of the bakery chain Paris Baguette. The items that were introduced to the Korean market aimed to introduce a French-inspired type of bread that would simultaneously satisfy a Korean taste palette. Hence, the type of bread and buns that were created were a fusion of Western technique and Korean flavours. Western fused breads are a growing phenomenon across Asia and as new Asian bakery chains grew in their home countries, they have simultaneously entered international markets.

<p Style="color: black">Happy Bakery's mission is to serves our families, employees, community, and God by preparing baked goods of exceptional quality that bring a special joy to life.

Our Vision:

We believe that every person has a right to food that is appropriate to that person and their culture. By food, we mean delicious food, nutritious food, comfort food, food of ritual, and food of celebration. By the right to food we mean not just immediate access to food on the table, but the resources and time to choose, grow, store, preserve, prepare and share food.

We believe in an economy based on love and solidarity, where people can be daily bread for each other, and provide for our communal well-being.

We believe in a food system which is ecologically just, healing and sustaining.

We understand that people’s access to food is limited by oppression in all forms, including the exploitative and dehumanizing relationships structured by the capitalist system, the global dominance of a destructive and profit-driven industrial food system, sexism, racism, heterosexism, trans-phobia, ableism and classism.
